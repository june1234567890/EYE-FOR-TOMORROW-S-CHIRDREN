Instructions for Analysis
Step 1: File Setup
1.	Place the EYE_FOR_TOMORROWS_CHILDREN_-DATA CLEANING.xlsx file and analysis_script.R in the same directory.
2.	Open analysis_script.R in RStudio or your R console.
Step 2: Run the R Script
1.	Adjust the file path in the script if necessary:
R
Copy code
file_path <- "EYE_FOR_TOMORROWS_CHILDREN_-DATA CLEANING.xlsx" 
2.	Execute the script line by line or run the entire file.

Outputs
Visualizations:
•	Age Distribution: Histogram showing participant age groups.
•	Awareness Responses: Bar plots visualizing survey responses.
•	Nationality Trends: Grouped bar plots analyzing responses by nationality.
Summary Statistics:
•	Age: Average, minimum, and maximum ages.
•	Response Counts: Distribution of categorical responses (e.g., awareness of child welfare).
Cleaned Data (Optional):
•	The script can save a cleaned version of the dataset as a CSV file:
R
Copy code
write.csv(data, "cleaned_data.csv") 
________________________________________
Customization
•	Modify column names in the script to match changes in the dataset.
•	Add new visualizations or analysis based on project requirements.
•	Use grouped analysis to explore correlations between demographics and responses.
________________________________________
Troubleshooting
•	File Not Found: Ensure the file path to the Excel file is correct.
•	Missing Packages: Install required packages using:
R
Copy code
install.packages("<package_name>") 
•	Column Name Mismatch: Update the column names in the script if they differ from the dataset.
